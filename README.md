# What's the Accent?
Accent guessing game
## About
This is a fun game that generates random quotes from a [free API](https://type.fit/api/quotes) alongside a random accent where users will read the quote in the accent generated and their opponents will try and guess the accent the quote is read in.

The app was created using React.js which enabled efficient usage of Hooks and Context api for state management while styling the app using Sass.

## Tools Used
- React.js
- Sass
- Type Fit api [Link](https://type.fit/api/quotes)
